<meta name="description" content="Given the dynamics of our changing society, judo has a lot to offer.  Judo recognises individual differences while at the same time caters for team-work within the club.  Some students may have an opportunity to experience administrative roles within the club.  Judo is a wonderful medium for integration. There is a mutual understanding between players the world over and it is common to find players of various nationalities practicing judo together.  As with any form of sport or martial art, it can serve as a great confidence builder, but most of all it is there to be enjoyed.  Judo has something to offer everybody. It is a completely natural activity for children. It can be a tough and demanding sport that will challenge any boy or girl and leave them contented at the end of a training session." />
